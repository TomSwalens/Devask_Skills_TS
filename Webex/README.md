Task name:
Webex
Task preparation:
VM with linux OS.
Task implementation:

Create a python script to make a webexroom.
Create another script to add members and posts.

I asked chatgpt to help me out with this. All I had to do is change a couple of variables (access token, people to invite, roomname, ...)

Task verification:
